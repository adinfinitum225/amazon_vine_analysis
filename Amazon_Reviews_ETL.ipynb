I love everything about pasta except the weight I've gained from pasta.  These noodles are a wonderful alternative to pasta.  You get a similar (not exactly the same) texture and you can use healthy sauces.  The noodles are little chewy/rubbery.  However, when I'm craving pasta and I know I shouldn't have any, the shirataki noodles are the best alternative.  These were a great find for me and my dietary needs/wants.  Note: you MUST rinse them.  I put them in a colander and rinse them for at least 10 minutes.\t2011-04-19                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n",

It is best to cut a corner off and drain all the water out over a screen of some type. I warn you, the water smells a bit funny. However, that smell does NOT translate to the noodle when in the meal so don't throw it away. The noodles are really really long and don't break as easy as normal pasta in your mouth so it is best to cut them up with a pair of kitchen scissors (i made them about 4\\\" or less). The package says two servings and I didn't think that would be correct when holding a package in my hand. However, the noodles really have a lot of substance and it is definitely two servings when you add other stuff. Not what I expected (thought I would get a package of dry noodles that had more servings) but they are great and I love them! What a relief to get a good noodle for soups, Italian dishes, and stir-fry without any carbs or calories. I just wish I could get these every month on a subscription like with other groceries.|\n",

We use them on the HCG diet - mostly with chicken and shrimp. They take on the flavor of  your dish, so for us it has been Old Bay Seasoning (or a similar alternative), Garlic and spices and the chicken. We affectionately refer to them as \\\"rubber noodles\\\\\" but not because they are rubbery, as I might have thought. Just because they are more stout out of the water than run of the mill noodles and are really long! The kids, which are both still pretty small, really like them! They haven't figured out that they're not the usual whole wheat pasta we normally fix. :) And because they take on the flavor of the dish, it isn't hard to make something they won't eat. Great find and excellent choice for anyone on a diet or wanting to make a healthy alternative. A little more expensive than brand x in the stores, but worth it, in my opinion, for better health.                                                                     |\n",

While I didn't expect anything approximating true noodles, I was not prepared for these.   This is only a noodle (or fettucine in this case) insofar as the shape is the same.  But that's where the similarity ends.   This is a translucent slimy tapeworm-resembling product that does not remotely resemble food.  I tried it with spaghetti sauce and cheese and the only thing that made it edible was mixing it with true pasta.  But of course that defeats the purpose of the zero calorie angle. While I was thinking perhaps this could act as a filler or stretcher for pasta to lessen the calories, I have to say it is not worth it.  I rather just eat the one or two forkfuls of real pasta than mix it with this.

I can create easy meals with them. Love to stir fry onions, garlic, fresh tomatoes and add seasonings , taco sauce or salsa , chili powder, ginger all in water. Then maybe some meat 3.5 ozs . Can slice frozen chicken breasts in processor then stir fry till done. Just a few minutes then rinse noodles in strainer and add to stir fry when everything else is done. You have a plate full of food and most calories are from the meat. Very satisfying. My husband has lost over 40-50 lbs and I have lost over 30 lbs. This is one addition to the rest of our lives. We can make this meal in less time then going for fast food. And even better make double portions for lunch the next day.\t2011-02-08                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n",

They don't have much of a taste at all but they do absorb flavor pretty well and they are filling too! I have heard some people say they have a fish smell but I did not experience that. There is an odor when you first open the bag that is not so pleasant but I didn't think it was fishy. Once you rinse them off the odor is gone. I saute some garlic and peppers with a little olive oil and red wine vinegar and add the noodles in. They soak up the yumminess. I have also tried them with soy sauce and some Asian stir fry veggies... Delicious and satisfying!!
